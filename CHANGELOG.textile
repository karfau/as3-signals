h2. AS3 Signals Changelog:


h3. v0.6 - GreenDay - 2010-03-17

h4. API Changes
* "#15 - IDeluxeSignal and NativeSignal now have valueClasses property":http://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals/issues/closed#issue/15

h4. Fixes
* "#14 - NativeSignal.addOnce() can't be reused after native event dispatched":http://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals/issues/closed#issue/14

h4. Implementation Changes
* Optimized listeners array cloning to use slice(), which is faster than concat().
* Optimized dispatch() by moving the cloning of listeners to add(), addOnce(), and remove().
* Signal.removeAll() now uses remove() on every listener, instead of fast array clearing. This is intended to avoid possible issues with subclass overrides (as happened before with NativeRelaySignal.remove()).
* Renamed createListenerRelationship() to registerListener().
* Consolidated add() and addOnce() logic in registerListener().
* Removed onceListeners Dictionary from DeluxeSignal and NativeSignal.
* DeluxeSignal and NativeSignal are now more unified in their "once listeners" internal implementations.
* Removed an extra semicolon which made FDT cry (thanks "vitch":http://github.com/vitch).

h4. Test Changes
* Removed async [Test] metadata because AsUnit 4 no longer uses it.
* Updated the AsUnit 4 SWC to newer version which avoids slowdown of Timers in Flash Player 10.1.
* Added tests for ambiguous relationships in Signal.
* Added tests for adding a listener during a dispatch().

h3. v0.5 - GlassHalfFull - 2010-02-08

* Added versioning to the Ant build, starting at 0.5.
